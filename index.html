    <h3>Q&A</h3>
        <p>Is the clothing high quality?</p>
            <p>Our company strives to keep the clothing as cheap as possible while making them last long and stay clean and stylish. Our fabric may not be as good as other companies, but it's the best for the price presented.</p>
        <p>What age range do you cover?</p>
            <p>We mostly do clothing for teens and adults, but if contacted, we can arrange making something for kids younger, prices will depending on the age and amount of fabric used.</p>
        <p>How long will this clothing last?</p>
            <p>These sets can last around 2-3 years depending on how much it's worn. It mainly just depends on what you do in the clothing. The fabric itself is durable enough to withstand normal situations.</p>
        <p>Is the clothing machine washable?</p>
            <p>Yes, these clothing were made to be washed in the washer and dryer.</p>
